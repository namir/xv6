a brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered
During debugging, the major difficulties were trying to
get cases were the nice value would be out of the range 
in which such integer values would be invalid priority. 
To essentially combat this, an extra usage and print statement
for invalid priority helps for this case. Another major difficulty is
having my priority to not correctly set to the pid up until the end of 
the completion of the lab. The value would be stored and set each for 
pid and priorities. The overall difficulties has been overcome and
will definately ensure that my usage of these strategies are used
in future.
