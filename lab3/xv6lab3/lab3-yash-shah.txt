ESTIMATE of time to complete lab: 4 hours

	Start	Time	Lab
Date	Time	Spent	Part	Work completed
----	-----	-----	----	---------
09/22   10:00   00:30   4       Mostly done with the Part 4
09/24	15:00	5:15	4	Figured out why my scheduling was wrong. 	
		5:45	TOTAL time spent

Difficulties encountered:

During the lab work, I realized that for-loop before the given for loop in 
scheduler refrains qemu from taking any keyboard input, which was unforeseen. 
It took me quite a while to figure that out. The code itself was very short, 
but the debugging done was huge and I had to create 2 test files to test why 
and how it works. But eventually, it ended up working. 
Cheers,
Yash.
